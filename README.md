# GPACalculator

A basic GPA calculator for college students who wish to keep track of their grades and know how they are doing throughout the quarter/semester. 
Users can input their current grades in the application and can then see what their overall GPA is for that quarter/semester.

Additionally, users can change the semester and add grades for various other semesters to calculate their overall GPA for their entire
college career.

Coming soon: Adding assignments to each course, cleaner UI, and more!
